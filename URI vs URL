A URI is an identifier of a specific resource. Like a page, or book, or a document.
A URL is special type of identifier that also tells you how to access it, such as HTTPs, FTP, etc.—like https://www.google.com.
If the protocol (https, ftp, etc.) is either present or implied for a domain, you should call it a URL—even though it’s also a URI.
